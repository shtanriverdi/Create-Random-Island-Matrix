# Create-Random-Island-Matrix

The purpose of this program is to create islands randomly with 1s and 0s and find number of islands in a boolean 2D matrix. It creates 5x5 Matrix and uses Recursive
Function, so you can take this code as an example to learn recursive function. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands;

sample matrix[5][5] = <br />{{1, 1, 0, 0, 1},<br />
                        {1, 1, 0, 0, 1},<br />
                        {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},<br />
                        {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},<br />
                        {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}}<br />
                   
Number Of Islands : 5
